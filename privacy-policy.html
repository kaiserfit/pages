        <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>
            Policy last updated on February 28, 2020
            <br><br>
            This is the Privacy Policy for kaizerfit.com (“Site”), which is owned and operated by KaizerFit (“Company” or “we” or “us”).
            <br><br>
            The following policy explains how we at KaizerFit collects and use personal information in detail. If you have any concerns about this policy, please feel free to contact us at service@kaiserfit.net.

        </p>
        <h3>Your Acceptance of this Privacy Policy</h3>
            <p>In accordance with this Privacy Policy, by registering and using this Site you are giving consent to our use and disclosure of your personal information and you signify your acceptance of this Policy, including, without limitation, signing up for offers and/or continuing to receive information from KaizerFit. This Privacy Policy is subject to the Terms of Use posted on the Site. If don’t accept the terms of this policy, in whole or part, do not access this site, and cancel your registration (if you signed up) by emailing us at service@kaiserfit.net

            </p>
            <h3>Registration, Collection and Use of Information</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Once you submit and complete any or part of the form in this Site you are considered as a “registrant”. Registering with KaizerFit automatically allows registration in any and all of the other sites in the KaizerFit’s network (collectively, the “Networks Sites”). Accordingly, we may share registrant PII with KaizerFit’s Network Sites. KaizerFit only gathers personal identifiable information (“PII”) that is volunteered during the registration process or in response to specific information requests. Examples of PII that may be requested consist of name, address, email address, and telephone number. We also collect credit card or other payment account information in connection with any purchase you make on or through the Site. The decision to provide PII is optional on your part; however, if you decide not to register or provide such information, you may not be able to make purchases on or use certain features of the Site or other services on or through the Site.

                </li>
                <li>
                    We may also automatically collect non-personal information that does not identify an individual user, such as ISP (internet service provider), IP (internet protocol) address, the Web browser used to visit the Site, which Web pages were visited on the Site, the time the Site is visited, a unique mobile device identifier (in connection with the use of the Sites or related services from mobile devices) and other anonymous Site usage data.
                </li>
                <li>
                    We may also connect personal information and non-personal information from users via “cookies” (small text files placed by us on user computers), single-pixel GIF image files (also called “Web beacons”), Web server log analysis and other similar technologies. Such information may be used to track usage trends and enhance the user experience and may be shared with third parties.
                </li>
                <li>
                    We use your PII and non-personal information for internal purposes, such as to provide you with the Site and services, to notify you of new products or services, and to otherwise communicate with you.
                </li>
                <li>
                    To the extent third parties may place advertising on the Site, such third parties may, and likely do, utilize cookies or other tracking technologies. We are not responsible for information collected by third parties in this manner, nor for the collection or use of information by other sites to which the Site is linked. By providing PII and other information to this Site, registrant fully understands and expressly consents to the collection and use of such information and the transfer of such information to Network Sites and other parties, in accordance with the terms of this Policy.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Sharing Information</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Company reserves the right to use registrant PII: (1) as disclosed at the time such information is provided and (2) as disclosed in this Policy. Your PII and non-personal information is only shared in accordance with the limited purposes in this privacy policy and the specific individual policies of our advertisers. Those limited purposes may include sharing such information with Network Sites and vendors who need the information to process and fulfill customer transactions. By clicking a submit button or taking other action on the Site to make a purchase and providing personal information on or through the Site, you agree:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            All information you have provided is true and correct to the best of your knowledge;
                        </li>

                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    We may work with third-party marketing and advertising companies (“Ad Networks”). These companies may collect and use information about your use of the Site or services in order to provide advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to you. Advertisements may be shown via the Site, the services, or third-party sites. These companies may place or recognize a unique cookie on your computer or use other technologies such as Web beacons. Our Privacy Policy does not cover any use of information that an Ad Network may collect from you. It also does not cover any information that you may choose to provide to an Ad Network or to an advertiser whose goods or services are advertised through the Site.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If you do not concur that Company may share your PII and non-personal information as described in this Privacy Policy, you should not register on and use the Site and, if you are already registered, you must immediately cancel your account, by following the instructions in “Opting-Out of Further Communications”.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Company attempts to advise others who receive registrant PII to support this Privacy Policy. Please be aware, however, that we have no control over such other party’s information use practices and we are not liable for any failure of such party to adhere to this Policy or otherwise to violate your privacy.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Finally, Company may disclose registrant PII in order to: (1) comply with applicable laws; (2) respond to governmental inquiries; (3) comply with valid legal process; and (4) protect the rights or property of Company, the Network Sites, or other registrants of this Site.
